# D&D 5e Staff of Shape Shifting Stat Tracker
Version 1.0.0

This is a tool for tracking stats of a character as the race (and racial features)
change in a D&D 5e campaign. 

Goals:
* Modular design - various pieces can be re-used if I eventually make this a web app
* Extensible design - new races can be added with minimal effort
* Easy to use - Command line first

### Staff of Shape Shifting.

Once daily you may activate the staff to change your race randomly. Stats and
abilities are adopted instantaneously with the transformation. Player
background does not change. 


(DM DISCRETION) 
The PC attuned to this item may recall the x previous races chosen by the staff 
and willingly use the daily transformation to return one of those races. The 
value of x may be:
- The PC's Int 
- All previously acheived races
- All races
